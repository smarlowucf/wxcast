Area Forecast Discussion

803 PM MDT Fri Jun 15 2018

.UPDATE...
Issued at 803 PM MDT Fri Jun 15 2018

Only changes to the forecast this evening will be taking out the
evening showers and thunderstorms when they die off. Loss of
diurnal heating should be enough to allow convection to diminish.

Satellite imagery over Arizona and New Mexico shows the large
swath of moisture heading northward which is expected to produce
an increase in shower activity over western Colorado tomorrow.

.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Saturday)
Issued at 326 PM MDT Fri Jun 15 2018

The southwesterly flow aloft increases overnight as an upper 
trough over the Pacific Northwest shifts a little further inland. 
With a ridge over the southeastern U.S. the models show increasing
subtropical moisture advecting from the Desert Southwest into the
cwa Saturday afternoon. For this evening, main issue with the 
storms will be gusty winds with limited rainfall. Dry and breezy 
conditions persisted over Jackson and Grand counties this 
afternoon so issued a Red Flag Warning there until 8 pm this 
evening. HRRR/RAP20 show scattered showers/tstms moving northeast 
across the cwa this afternoon and evening. Better low level 
moisture to the north and east, so marginal risk for isolated 
severe thunderstorms near the Wyoming and Nebraska borders. Main 
impact appears to be hail to one inch and wind gusts to 60 mph. 
Elsewhere, drier in the low level with gusty outflow winds the 
main impact from tstms. By Saturday, models forecast soundings 
show precipitable water values increasing to around 0.80 inches by
the afternoon. Better chance of showers and thunderstorms will 
develop. Forecast CAPES over the northeast plains not as high, so 
overall threat for severe thunderstorms should be low. Increasing 
moisture some slightly cooler max temperatures should lessen the 
overall fire danger over the cwa. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)
Issued at 326 PM MDT Fri Jun 15 2018

...Main concern for this forecast period will surround locally 
heavy rainfall this weekend into early next week...

For Saturday evening, the remnants of Tropical Storm Bud will pass
across the forecast area. Precipitable water increases to around 1
inch on the plains, so storms that do develop will be capable of
producing brief heavy rainfall, and there's still perhaps enough
instability for a severe storm or two with gusty winds and hail
the main threat. Mountain and foothill locations will also have 
potential for heavy rain, but storms should be moving along at a
fair clip so even in the burn scars we don't see much threat of
excessive rainfall.  

On Sunday, we'll see a cold front arrive by morning with light
upslope winds developing during the day. We still expect
enough daytime heating to destabilize the atmosphere sufficiently
for numerous shower and thunderstorm development in the afternoon
and evening. 700-500 mb specific humidity will be near 6 g/kg, 
and Precipitable Water (PW) is forecast to be near 1.10-1.25 
inches across the plains. These values are in the standardized 
anomaly range of 2-3, so its a pretty rare event for this time in
June, but closer to the values we'd see in a monsoonal surge in 
July/August. Warm cloud depths are advertised to range between 
3500 and 6000 feet depending on model output, which is pretty 
healthy for June. As a result, we do expect locally heavy
rainfall, with the main threat for flooding in burn scars. Urban
areas or low lying/poor drainage areas may also see some flooding
impacts should a stronger storm move through. Storm movement is 
expected to range between 15 and 20 knots, and latest indications 
suggest a couple severe storms will still be possible given 0-6 km
shear of 35-50 knots. We'll watch that threat as well over the 
next couple days and see what CAPE will be available. Preliminary 
numbers suggest we should be seeing values near 1000-1500 J/kg. 

It looks like this pattern will stay in place Monday through
Wednesday, with continued thunderstorm chances and potentially 
locally heavy rainfall during this period. Monday will likely be
more stable so most activity will be confined to in/near the
foothills. Tuesday and Wednesday should see a better chance of
showers/storms spreading back out onto the plains with a stronger
disturbance kicking out of the southwest U.S. trough. We could see
a few more severe storms as well depending on instability. 

We'll then trend back toward climatology by the end of next week,
but still offer a chance of thunderstorms each day during this 
slight warming trend.

.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Saturday evening)
Issued at 803 PM MDT Fri Jun 15 2018

Shower activity has ended over the Denver area this evening and
now winds are responding to the passage of outflow boundaries from
showers on the northeast Colorado plains. In the next couple
hours, winds should return to diurnal drainage patterns.
Increasing moisture aloft tomorrow is going to lead to an active
afternoon with showers and thunderstorms rolling off the foothills
and across the Denver metro area. 

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 803 PM MDT Fri Jun 15 2018

Red Flag Warning in Middle and North Parks has been cancelled.
Fire behavior conditions have eased as temperatures cooled down
and humidity levels started to rise. Increasing shower activity
over the mountains in the next several days should help diminish
fire weather concerns as we head into next week.
