.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Friday)
Issued at 331 PM MST Thu Nov 30 2017

Quasi-zonal flow aloft and a dry airmass will pretty much 
remain place overnight. Mtn top westerly winds are to begin
increasing in speed this evening with an upstream jet maxima
nearing the state. A batch of mid/upper-level moisture accompanies
this maxima. Both are timed to pass over northern Colorado late 
tonight/early Tomorrow morning. Could see mtn top winds speeds of 
35-45kts during this period, as well as mostly cloudy to overcast
skies. Can't rule out a few light snow showers obscuring the 
higher peaks for a few hours, but the chance for snow accumulation
appears quite low. 

On the plains, gusty south-southwest winds roughly east of a 
Sterling-to-Elbert line have already begin to weaken, and the 
trend will continue into the early evening hours under clear to 
mostly clear sky. After midnight, however, mid-level moisture 
quickly moves in from the west which will fuel some mtn wave 
cloud development over and east of the nrn Front Range. South of 
there, do not expect to see all that much cloud cover. Overnight 
temperatures should be slightly warmer than last night, esply 
under the mtn wave clouds in the breezy areas of the Front Range 
foothills. 

On Friday, the above mentioned wave of strong upper-level winds 
and moisture move east of the forecast area, and in its wake 
look for slightly drier air to filters in over the area on a 
north-northwesterly low-level flow. By afternoon, winds on the 
plains should turn northeasterly, but the lack of moisture should
only result in some mid-level upslope cloudiness over and along 
the foothills and Palmer Divide, but no precip. Highs tomorrow, 
even with the northerly breezes are progged to be a few degs 
warmer than those today. For Denver, that means a high temp 13-16
degrees above the average for the 1st of December. FYI, the normal
high for Denver tomorrow is 45. 


.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)
Issued at 331 PM MST Thu Nov 30 2017

Model solutions continue to differ significantly with this system, 
but none have this storm producing large amounts of snow. Pops have 
been added for Sunday through Tuesday morning over the mountains and 
rain will change to snow Monday near the northern border and move 
south. The ECMWF and GFS show the a front moving in on Monday.

The QG Omega fields have weak downward vertical velocity for the CWA 
through Saturday, then increasing upward energy is progged Saturday 
night into the extended periods. There is nothing significant to the 
low level winds, mainly just normal diurnal patterns. The normal 
drainage winds Saturday night look to be enhanced a bit concerning 
speeds, more so over the eastern plains. Moisture is pretty sparse 
Friday through Saturday, with some increasing in the upper level 
Saturday night. There is no measurable precipitation on the QPF 
fields through Saturday night.

High temperatures will be near 60 degrees F on the plains and 
40-50 degrees F through the weekend. Temperatures will drop about
20 degrees Monday and remain low through Wednesday.

VFR conditions for the next 24 hours. Light east-northeast winds

after dark. On Friday, light drainage flow is expected to become
light and variable by mid to late morning, only to become light
northeasterly by the afternoon.
